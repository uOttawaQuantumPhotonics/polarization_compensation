# polarization_compensation
We present a fast and automated method for polarization compensation using liquid crystals. This approach combines rotating quarter-waveplate polarimetry with liquid crystal cell voltage adjustments, offering high-fidelity compensation suitable for diverse applications. Our method directly solves for compensation parameters, avoiding reliance on stochastic approaches or cryptographic metrics. See our paper for further details: ...
